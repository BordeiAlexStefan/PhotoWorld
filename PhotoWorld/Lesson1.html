	<h2> Lesson 1 - Exposure </h2> 
	<article>
		<p> What is the right exposure. Not to make this complicated, but exposure is a choice you have to make. The exposure you choose determines how the image looks. But, we'll start with a basic understanding and work up from there.</p>

		<h4> Exposure consist of five factors: </h4>
		<ol>
			<li> how much light is in front of you - which can be changed by adding lights or flash</li>
			<li> how sensitive the film is to light - called ISO </li>
			<li>the amount of light going through a lens - called the aperture</li>
			<li>long the film is exposed - called the shutter speed</li>
			<li>you want the image to look like, especially when light is beside or behind the subject.</li>
		</ol>
		
	
		<p> <span class="exercise">Exercise:</span> set your ISO to 100, set your camera to f16 and the shutter to 1/125th of a second. (Some digital cameras are limited to ISO 200 - which means you have to cut your exposure by one stop, i.e. use 1/250th instead of 1/125th of a second) With this setting, take your camera out during a sunny day, put the sun behind you and shoot anything - you'll have a well exposed image. This is called the "Sunny 16" rule.</p>

		<h4> High Key  </h4>
			
		<p> A high-key photo is basically white on white. This style of photography conveys a feeling of lightness and clarity. Typically what happens is the camera wants to make the white of the photo - without dark areas to 'balance' the exposure - too dark. So your white's become gray. You may have seen this particularly when shooting a snowy field on a gray day. However, exposing for high key is fairly easy.</p>
		<p> <span class="exercise" >Exercise:</span> Put a large piece of white paper or white fabric on a table beside a large north facing window, place a white object such as a Styrofoam cup or egg in the middle.</p>
	</article>
	
		<article>
		<h4> Low Key  </h4>
		
		<p> This is the opposite of the high key. A low key photo is pretty much black on black, or at least very dark on dark. This kind of photo can create a sense of intimacy, foreboding, sadness, and / or heaviness. You might have a face or object rimmed with light in a silhouette, but dark on the side towards the camera and dark background.</p>
		<p>	The problem with shooting dark on dark is that the camera will try to lighten the image up making the picture look washed out and grey. For this shot you'll need a really dark cloth, preferably black, and an object that is dark or has some dark tones in it. You could shoot a portrait of a dark haired person in dark clothing against a black or dark background for a low-key portrait. </p>
		<p> <span class="exercise" >Exercise:</span>  First, shoot the image with what you camera says is the right exposure. Very few in-camera meters will render this scene accurately. Now, take a meter reading on something dark/black that has the light hitting it and close the aperture two stops (i.e. if it is f1.8 you'll want to go to f4.)</p>

		<p> Compare the two images and see what difference it made.</p>
