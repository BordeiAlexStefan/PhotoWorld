	<p> With the basic lessons you can begin to take better photos of any subject and get more enjoyment from your photography. You'll find this is a great online photography school to make better use of your camera, whether it is a dSLR or pocket camera or even your smart phone camera. </p>
	<p> Photography is an art and you are the artist. If you're thinking you could never be an artist I have good news for you - you already are. Even just taking the time to read this page you've shown you have the desire make images that give you pleasure and can affect others - that is art.</p>
	<p> To get the most out of each lesson, do the exercise(s). Sounds too simple, but many people don't actually do this. If you physically get out and shoot these ideas, you'll automatically become a better photographer just because you're thinking about "how" you take the photos.</p>
